# Workers' Comp Rate Intelligence & Timing Analytics Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development roadmap for a specialized workers' compensation rate intelligence and claim optimization platform. The solution leverages commercial payer transparency data alongside workers' compensation fee schedules to identify savings opportunities, while incorporating timing analytics to improve claim outcomes and reduce disability durations.

## Market Opportunity

Workers' compensation claims management faces several key challenges:

1. **Rate Optimization**: Standard bill review relies primarily on fee schedules, missing opportunities where commercial rates may be lower
2. **Treatment Timing**: Delays in care coordination significantly impact claim costs and outcomes
3. **TPA Oversight**: Self-insured employers often lack tools to verify TPA performance
4. **Data Fragmentation**: Disconnected systems prevent holistic view of claim efficiency

This platform addresses these gaps by combining rate intelligence with timing analytics to create a comprehensive claim optimization solution.
